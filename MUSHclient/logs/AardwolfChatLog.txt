@w[10 Dec 17:55:05] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YHotah: the meditate help file says it's an automatic skill. Does that mean I get it's bonus whether standing,sitting or sleeping or do I have to manually type "meditate" to get it's benefits?
@w[10 Dec 18:41:34] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAlphaks: where to buy a boat?
@w[10 Dec 18:42:53] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAlphaks: niteglo has a raft :P
@w[10 Dec 18:51:18] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YAphelion: Hotah, meditate is checked at every tick to see if it was successful.
@w[10 Dec 18:52:57] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YAphelion: however, the help file states:  @W[C]ertain characters are able to use focus and concentration@Y when resting @Win order to increase their mana recovery rate

@w[10 Dec 21:10:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: Hey guys, I have a quest where i need to find some pixie wings in the Temple of Doom, but Can't seem to find any... any advice?
@w[10 Dec 21:12:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YMique: a quest from a questor or some area goal?
@w[10 Dec 21:12:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Hm...I see two different things going on for you Ashuram...I see you're on a quest from questor...but the pixie wings are generally included in a goal, so I'm a bit confused.  Is the Pixie your Quest mob or are you doing a goal and a quest?
@w[10 Dec 21:12:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: It's a task I received from someone here in the Temple of Doom. I am on a quest (already completed, from the Academy) and this one task here.
@w[10 Dec 21:12:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: The pixie one is from a goal, the goal Believer
@w[10 Dec 21:12:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Hm, you haven't complete your quest yet...better go back to the academy and quest complete...quests are on a time limit.
@w[10 Dec 21:13:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: Nod, will do that then and return back here once I've completed it
@w[10 Dec 21:13:10] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: Thanks
@w[10 Dec 21:13:25] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: And while you're there in Aylor, get a potion of detect invis...pixies are often invisible!
@w[10 Dec 21:13:45] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAshuram: Ah! That might be the anwser why I can't seem to find it.. thanks!
@w[10 Dec 21:13:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: that kills two birds with one stone, so to speak!!
@w[10 Dec 21:13:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: No problem, glad to help!
@w[10 Dec 21:23:56] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Welcome to Aardwolf, Proudmoore!
@w[10 Dec 21:42:26] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: is the maze in gauntlet changing?
@w[10 Dec 21:42:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: i tried to make some notes but after recall and coming back the rooms seems to be different now  :(
@w[10 Dec 21:43:06] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, that one is a random maze I believe.
@w[10 Dec 21:43:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: great!
@w[10 Dec 21:43:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: so how do you supposed to find a mob in here?
@w[10 Dec 21:43:33] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, I know what you mean, it is challenging.
@w[10 Dec 21:44:19] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Well, some people use the kill all approach.  And then there's some hints in help maze solving as well.  Basically, I scan and then move to a mob I haven't seen before.  Some mobs you can scan for but some mobs in there are "no scan" too.
@w[10 Dec 21:45:00] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: this shouldnt be a level 6 campaging challenge.  mapped alot of rooms for nothing
@w[10 Dec 21:45:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: What is your mob?
@w[10 Dec 21:45:26] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: the crawling claw
@w[10 Dec 21:46:48] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: never saw it so far
@w[10 Dec 21:46:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Usually what I do firsst when I have a gauntlet mob is check on the gaardian roominator (help www for the site info) and make sure the mob isn't no scan...I checked for you, and you will be able to scan for the mob.
@w[10 Dec 21:48:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Then, like I said...move about the maze scanning frequently (you can use scan claw to narrow it down)...and just for example, if you see a ghost, move to the ghost, scan again for your mob and then just use regular scan to move on to something you haven't seen before.  Eventually you will find it.
@w[10 Dec 21:48:48] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRantar: ok i will, thank you
@w[10 Dec 22:04:28] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: hi all

@w[10 Dec 22:46:09] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: i don't understand, i explored more than 300 rooms and completed more than 2 quests, i can't graduate still
@w[10 Dec 22:46:09] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: any ideas?
@w[10 Dec 22:46:09] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YMique: why  not what message do you get?
@w[10 Dec 22:46:46] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: oh... maybe it meant quests, not goals
@w[10 Dec 22:46:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YMique: and you completed 2 quests you got from a questor and for which you received qp? not 2 area goals
@w[10 Dec 22:47:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YMique: it said quests so yes meant quests not something else
@w[10 Dec 22:47:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: quests means by questmasters
@w[10 Dec 22:47:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMordrax: all rite, thanks
@w[10 Dec 22:55:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: Hi folks, how do I set auctions to not show on screen?
@w[10 Dec 22:55:30] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YSaraid: type auction
@w[10 Dec 22:55:32] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YSaraid: this works for pretty much every channel
@w[10 Dec 22:55:46] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: thanks!
@w[10 Dec 22:55:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: You can turn off auction channel...I'd almost advise you not to do it though, you would miss out on a lot.  it's not usually as busy as it has been this morning.
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: I wish I could send all pages into a separate window, lol. I seem to miss things as I'm fighting sometimes.
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Are you using Aardmush?
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: Honestly? have no idea. I dl'd the ardwolf client if thats what you mean
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, that's the one.  You can set all channels and such to go to communications log and then just have your fights in the main window.
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: oh, cool... um... how?
@w[10 Dec 22:58:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Unless you're on a phone on Blowtorch...
@w[10 Dec 23:01:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: If you're on a PC on the mushclient from the Aardwolf webpage, right click on your communication log...You may have to play around with it a little to get it the way you like it but there's options to move it all up to comm log.  They can help you out with it on tech channel if you have difficulties.
@w[10 Dec 23:01:52] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNebbitt: thank you 
@w[10 Dec 23:02:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YMique: you might look at help nospam also

@w[12 Dec 19:12:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: to show you: first type keep skin
@w[12 Dec 19:12:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: that will save your viper skin from accidental loss.
@w[12 Dec 19:12:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: then type wear skin
@w[12 Dec 19:12:44] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@RImm@W)@Y @YAnaristos: the viper skins probably the best item in your inventory right now.

@w[13 Dec 00:32:06] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMujaro: How can you kiss anybody, you're intangible!
@w[13 Dec 00:32:06] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Check out the blackboard and there's a hint to help you find the answer.
@w[13 Dec 00:32:37] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRavinmia: thanks ,  unfortinatily that tip is only worth a hand shake 
@w[13 Dec 00:34:20] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: That's all any hint is worth to me, rofl!

@w[13 Dec 00:36:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRedhare: shake bob
@w[13 Dec 00:36:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRedhare: since I assume that's what you're doing, because I got stuck there too
@w[13 Dec 00:36:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: It's shakes to shake a hand.
@w[13 Dec 00:36:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRavinmia: whoohoo 
@w[13 Dec 00:36:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Nah, she's just trying to shake our hands this time!  I'd remember that for future reference though Ravinmia, you're going to run into it again!
@w[13 Dec 00:39:20] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @YRavinmia nods

@w[13 Dec 00:42:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRedhare: thanks
@w[13 Dec 00:42:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRedhare: yeah crap, can I get some help with a retrieval?

@w[13 Dec 00:46:46] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMujaro: Generally, no.
@w[13 Dec 00:46:46] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: No, Ravinmia...Player killing is only allowed in the PK system...unless you interfere in someone elses fight (by healing an opponent or some such) they won't be able to kill you.

@w[14 Dec 17:16:49] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YWarBurger: the options will be there =)
@w[14 Dec 17:16:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @YOwen gallantly tips his hat to WarBurger.
@w[14 Dec 17:17:33] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @YWarBurger bows deeply.
@w[14 Dec 17:17:35] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YOwen: It's been years since I have had to set that...completely forgot :P
@w[14 Dec 17:56:26] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YSolemn: So at level 80 I should buy an Aard Dagger, is this correct?
@w[14 Dec 17:56:35] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YSolemn: It may be 81...
@w[14 Dec 18:04:32] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YJurema: where do i buy potions
@w[14 Dec 18:05:35] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YHotah: try 'find potion' at recall
@w[14 Dec 18:05:57] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YHotah: I think that's it. I'm pretty new
@w[14 Dec 22:51:10] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: And also, if the info's on notes is bothering you, you can turn those off...
@w[14 Dec 22:51:28] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: by typing info notes (it's a toggle, so the same would turn it back on).
@w[14 Dec 22:51:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YBlackwish: oh lol ty
@w[14 Dec 22:51:52] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRahone: Help Subscribe also works to learn how to withdraw from just specific boards of Notes being posted too
@w[14 Dec 22:52:02] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: I have those off so I didn't realize what exactly you were seeing!
@w[14 Dec 22:52:29] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YRahone: I'll be the SuperNewbie (Helper) over there, Acoxochitl.
@w[14 Dec 22:52:31] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, that is helpful too!
@w[14 Dec 22:52:40] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Glad to have you Rahone!
@w[14 Dec 22:52:47] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @YRahone rides up upon his warhorse and salutes with fist to heart.

@w[17 Dec 23:36:24] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAdrani: what the heck?? a beggar took 25 gold so i killed him and then he only dropped 11!
@w[17 Dec 23:36:47] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YDash: clearly he already spent it on booze
@w[17 Dec 23:36:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAdrani: damn that was quick
@w[17 Dec 23:37:05] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: That happens sometimes...and some of them will take more than that!  Best to keep most of your gold in the bank and only carry what you need.
@w[17 Dec 23:37:33] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAdrani: it's ok, it's easy to get gold in this game\
@w[17 Dec 23:37:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: It gets even easier too at higher levels!
@w[17 Dec 23:38:08] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAdrani: gold doesnt seem that important? I haven't found anything too expensive
@w[17 Dec 23:38:37] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: really? I don't think it's useful either
@w[17 Dec 23:39:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: good eqs are from qps if I'm not wromg
@w[17 Dec 23:39:36] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: wrong*
@w[17 Dec 23:40:21] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Ya
@w[17 Dec 23:40:43] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: You'll use gold to buy some equipment...sometimes you might pay gold for an enchanter to enchant those items for you...or for an enchanter to enchant your aarditems...then there's Mastery and Instinct (endgame, both have helpfiles and require a lot of gold).
@w[17 Dec 23:40:47] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yen
@w[17 Dec 23:41:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y]: @Yo
@w[17 Dec 23:41:57] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: So is there a place where I can keep excess inv or isnt there any reason to do this?
@w[17 Dec 23:42:18] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: put in a bag? 
@w[17 Dec 23:42:31] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: there is no carry-limit?
@w[17 Dec 23:42:53] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: There is a weight limit.
@w[17 Dec 23:43:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: and item limit.  Check out help weight.
@w[17 Dec 23:43:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok so if I reach that limit I should sell stuff or throw it away? 
@w[17 Dec 23:43:58] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YAdrani: a lot of mobs are telling me, damn i should have stayed in bed today, before dying, does that mean you had a strong attack?
@w[17 Dec 23:44:45] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, you want to try to manage your inventory because after remort you will go back to a similiar carrying capacity to when you started.
@w[17 Dec 23:45:03] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok, understood
@w[17 Dec 23:45:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Soooo...only keep important things, like enchanted gear, aard items, portals, goal items...and sell unneeded items often, drop and sac unneeded.  Make sure and use "keep" (help keep) to hold onto the items you don't want to sell.
@w[17 Dec 23:46:57] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok
@w[17 Dec 23:47:02] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: how do I use my lantern?
@w[17 Dec 23:47:19] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: there are a couple of very expensive options to allow you to keep more items and I want you to be aware of them...pockets wish and vault.  But, they are both very expensive and your qp's and trivia points have better uses at this point.
@w[17 Dec 23:47:34] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok
@w[17 Dec 23:48:02] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Hold lantern, Zommes.  I would get a hallowed light instead of a lantern...cause lanterns burn out (sometimes at the worst possible times) and hallowed lights are permanent.
@w[17 Dec 23:49:10] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok, cool where can I buy a hallowed light?
@w[17 Dec 23:49:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: I gave you one just then!
@w[17 Dec 23:49:45] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: They're made by players and often you can ask on barter for someone to auction and they wil.
@w[17 Dec 23:50:09] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok, cool so there's a bit of crafting in the game aswell??
@w[17 Dec 23:50:11] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: is there any point on increasing instinct on dodge?
@w[17 Dec 23:50:12] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: As long as I'm doing it...if anyone else needs a hallowed light, come 2s of recall and I will make you one as well.
@w[17 Dec 23:50:17] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YTrurien: Something like that, Zommes.
@w[17 Dec 23:50:36] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: Ok, where can I read about it?
@w[17 Dec 23:50:45] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: There is eventually Reptillus but not right now for you...your trains will be better used training stats at this point.
@w[17 Dec 23:52:04] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: For the newer player, it's best not to sacrifice stats for instinct...doing so will cause you to level verrrrrry slowly.  Towards the end of the remort if you can find someone to drag you to superhero from level 186, you can then deposit the unneeded trains you get for future instinct but at this point, I would train instead of trying to do instinct.
@w[17 Dec 23:52:52] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: ok, understood. And I should but most points in my class-stats and a bit in the rest right?
@w[17 Dec 23:53:29] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: oops I see now that I have 29 unused sessions
@w[17 Dec 23:53:39] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: We usually advise to train all until they cost 2, without neglecting your primaries...and then after all is at 2, just train your primaries.
@w[17 Dec 23:53:40] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: i don't feel the difference greatly in my stat points
@w[17 Dec 23:53:53] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: You won't at this point, Reptillus...but you will towards the end.
@w[17 Dec 23:54:18] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: And for the amount that you'd be able to save up and buy instinct for, you wouldn't get much gain from it either.
@w[17 Dec 23:54:54] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: can I rename bags?
@w[17 Dec 23:55:21] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: i have 0 trains and 30 practices, what should I do with them? 
@w[17 Dec 23:55:21] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YRedryn: costs tps
@w[17 Dec 23:55:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@mAdvisor@W)@Y @YRedryn: convert them to trains
@w[17 Dec 23:56:08] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: is it good to convert to trains? 
@w[17 Dec 23:56:27] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: It costs trivia points to rename or add a keyword to a bag so i wouldn't advise doing it to any kind of bag except an aard bag.
@w[17 Dec 23:57:23] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: what is an aardbag? 
@w[17 Dec 23:57:36] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: a special bag? 
@w[17 Dec 23:57:58] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: Yea, it's one of the items you can buy with quest points...help aarditems.
@w[18 Dec 00:07:17] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: how do I define different potions when wanting to drink them quickly or put in a bag?
@w[18 Dec 00:09:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: I have 3 different potions and cant seem to put them in a bag
@w[18 Dec 00:10:14] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: what are you typing to put them in?
@w[18 Dec 00:10:40] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: i tried put <..> in <..> 
@w[18 Dec 00:10:51] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: put itemname bag, check out help containers.
@w[18 Dec 00:11:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAcaxochitl: You're just using too many words, that's all!
@w[18 Dec 00:11:14] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: oh well, I shouldnt use 'in' indeed

@w[18 Dec 12:42:18] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YWigbert: I am trying to leave the lower planes  ... what does Checking for blindness flag before marking this room norecall...  mean?
@w[18 Dec 12:43:31] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: Just a line from your mapper. It means its checking to see if you are blind, before it marks the room as being a norecall room
@w[18 Dec 12:43:46] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: you can only exit that area from the first room that you landed in when you entered the pool
@w[18 Dec 12:45:17] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YWigbert: so I am hopelessly lost then
@w[18 Dec 12:49:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YWigbert: Well I forgot where I came in. Any tips on finding my way out of the lower planes maze pool 1?
@w[18 Dec 12:50:31] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: The room with all of the pets in it is usually it :) Which is why there are so many pets here
@w[18 Dec 12:50:40] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: They are used as a marker / hunting trick
@w[18 Dec 12:51:07] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YWigbert: I guess I never bothered to get a pet yet
@w[18 Dec 12:56:17] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YWigbert: woot! home sweet home.  thanks folks
@w[18 Dec 12:58:50] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNayla: Sho...where do I get thus damn apple?
@w[18 Dec 12:59:42] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: for the academy?

@w[18 Dec 13:00:05] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: Try using find all while in aylor
@w[18 Dec 13:00:18] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: and then going to an appropriate shop that would sell apples
@w[18 Dec 13:07:31] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YNayla: Yeah...where the heck is the farm?
@w[18 Dec 13:07:37] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: runto kimr
@w[18 Dec 13:07:55] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMujaro: GO to recall point and 'runto farm'
@w[18 Dec 13:08:20] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YGranola: you can "runto recall" while in aylor, that way you dont waste movement points
@w[18 Dec 13:09:52] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YMujaro: Can also use the academy portal and then go down once.
@w[18 Dec 13:13:02] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YReptillusMax: do the in-game weather and time are the same for every players?

@w[19 Dec 00:30:13] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: so if I have different potions and want to put them in a bag, I have to use their id's? it seems I cannot use put healing potion bag i.e.
@w[19 Dec 00:30:42] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YOannes: Maybe 'put healing bag'
@w[19 Dec 00:30:45] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @W(@GHelper@W)@Y @YAyasinda: you can use a keyword of the potion
@w[19 Dec 00:31:32] @Y[@MNewbie@Y] @YZommes: aaah ok, I didnt think it would work without potion, but it does.
